1.Introduction:
  Cloud Recording JAVA SDK provides a JAVA API for Agora Cloud Recording Clients.
  The name of interface is almost similiar with the one of raw C++.
  Use this SDK, you can easily access to our Agora Cloud Recording System and enjoy the Cloud Recoding service.
  The final record files will be stored on the Cloud Storage provided by clients themselves.
    
2.Environment:
  Please check you have installed JAVA. Until now, OpenJDK 1.6+ has been tested and can work.

3.Guidance:
  (1) API
  createCloudRecorderInstance
    Before everything, You should create an instance at first.
    This instance can be used to start and stop recording.
  
  startCloudRecording
    After create instance, you can use this instance to start cloud recording.
    Cloud Recording System will check your provided info first and start recording if everything is ok.

  stopCloudRecording
    After start recording, you can stop the recording every time using the same instance.

  release
    Be remember to release the instance when you don't use it any more. It will clean up the resource.

  (2) Usage
  Under the demo folder, you can see demo codes and we have generated the jar by this codes under target folder.
  If you want to run this demo, you can try:
    java -Xbootclasspath/a:../lib/agora-cloud-recording-sdk.jar: -jar -Dsun.boot.library.path=../lib target/cloud-recording-client-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <options>
  For the <option>, you can use "-h" to get the help info
  Also you can input some commands when the demo is running(demo will start cloud recording automatically):
    "help": see the detailed command
    "stop": it will call stopCloudRecording
    "quit": it will quit the demo
  After recording stopped, the instance will be released automatically.

  If you want to call these APIs by your own code, please remember to include these two lib file under libs folder:
    libagora-cloud-recording-java.so is the JNI C++ lib
